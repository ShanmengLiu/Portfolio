					<h1>Introduction of Client System</h1>
					<p>Ann Arbor District Library (AADL) uses an events engine to create and communicate about events held at the library.</p>
					<p>The tasks performed using this engine include the following four tasks -</p>
						<ul>
							<li>proposing an event, 
							<li>reviewing or updating event information</li>
							<li>searching for events and related details as an input to other tasks like creating publicity materials, making payments, and planning future events.</li>
						</ul>

				<h2>Stakeholder Interview</h2>
				<p>Through this initial client meeting, we get to know the system we are going to evaluate. We collaborated directly with our main contact (stakeholder) to acquire the contact information of 10 library staff members whose roles and responsibilities intersected with event planning, coordination, and creation.</p>
				<h2>Building Interaction Map</h2>
				<p>Three persons of the group visit the website together to look for any breakdowns in the interaction with the system.</p>
				<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
				<p>We conduct interviews respectively with Events Manager, Library Technician, Services and Collections Manager, Graphic Designer. We then transcribe our interviews recordings individually and construct affinity notes in group. Next, we synthesized findings. Through this study, we learnt a lot about the problems about current website.</p>
				<h2>Comparative Evaluations</h2>
				<p>We hold several rounds of discussions to determine criteria and comparators by synthesizing our findings of features of possible comparators. Through this study, we further identify weakness of our client's event engine and find best practice for improvements for client's event engine.</p>
				<h2>Surveys</h2>
				<p>First, we determined our research goals and questions, target population, and sampling and recruiting strategies. Next, we designed our survey questionnaire, taking into consideration best practices for question and response design. Before deploying our survey, we conducted a pilot test with several people in order to find and correct problems with our questionnaire and/or data collection plans. Through this study, we gained a broad understanding of a product's current or potential users in order to learn about their needs, attitudes, characteristics, and current practices.</p>
				<h2>Heuristics Evaluation</h2>
				<p>I evaluted the website based on a checking list with Nielsen's heuristicsh and discussed with my other team members evaluation result.</p>
				<h2>Usability Test</h2>
				<p>I observed a user performing tasks defined according to real tasks taken by real users. Along with that, I documented usalbility problems happening during the process.</p>
