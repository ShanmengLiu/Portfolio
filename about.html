				<h1>My Story</h1>
				<div>
					<p>Right, I am a UX designer and also a UX researcher in that design and research can not live without each other.</p>
					<p>I have been interested in people since I was a little kid. Why do they laugh? What are they looking at? Why do they have this action? Why do they say that? What are they thinking? These are psychology things. For some reasons, I chose Management Information System as my undergraduate major instead of Psychology. I studied business and management courses like Human Resources and Marketing and E-commerce which absolutely included human behaviors topics. Along with this, I studied JAVA and algorithms and database and operation system which built my technology foundation.</p>
					<p>After I graduated, I chose to further my study as a master student in School of Information, University of Michigan. And I chose Human Computer Interaction as my focus. For the first term, I learnt graphic design and systematically studied human behaviors and I finished a contextual inquiry team project for a 3D printing Lab. For the second term, I worked with another team to carry out user research for Ann Arbor District Library and I did a personal UX design project for fostering communication in the community I live. Meanwhile, I learnt HTML and CSS and JS and PHP and did several python course projects. Through all of this, I gained professional knowldge of human computer interaction design and web programming.</p>
					<p>Hey, come on! Look at my projects! You don't want to miss them.</p>
